# GreenScreen
Trying to Simulate the GreenScreen technique through the use of Library Pillow

<ul>
  <li/>See to it that the python library Pillow is installed beforehand. It has been used instead of PIL since the latter couldn't be reliably downloaded during the time of creation of the given Py file.
  <li/>In Python terminal, go for <code>pip install Pillow==2.2.2</code>.
  <li/>The given images <b>BuFu0Pz</b>, <b>maxresdefault</b> are courtesy of Google Images, and are used only for testing the python code.
  <li/>In order to change them, to any other set of images, see to it that the image names are suitably changed in the python code, ehile initializing <i>im1, im2</i>.
  <li/>The file <i>out.tif</i>(due to useof tif in similar artistic ventures) is a saved result of the python code and changes with evry instance of <i>greenscreen.py</i> being changed.
  <li/>In order to run the code, either run through your python interface or use <code>python greenscreen.py</code> from a relative path on the terminal
  <li/>Keep in mind that the resolution of im1 and of im2 must be appropriate, so that the index does not exceed. Moreover the path of the images must be proper so as to load them efficiently 
  <li/>Any onlookers might try to test the code for different colours and circumstances, and try to enhance it similarly.
